# geekout2021 - medicine management application for seniors

This was a project coded in a 24h hackathon, so some functionality is missing and 
this project is only optimised for mobile and the layout for desktop is terrible ðŸ˜”

This application's purpose is to help seniors gain some independence and manage their 
medicine taking while giving updates to their caregivers to offer peace of mind.
